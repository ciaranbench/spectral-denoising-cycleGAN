Training/validation/test data can be downloaded from this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d7KSXt-ZDyDc_YGKFiEZV5ckLYmrl6y8?usp=sharing).
The original spectral dataset adapted for this study can be found [here](https://github.com/conor-horgan/DeepeR). 

Training scripts were written for TensorFlow 2.12
